1. We can get the pid by call the getpid() function inside the conditional statement if(p == 0)

2. For all the child processes except #2, we can kill the process by calling "kill(getpid(), SIGKILL);" inside the function after we forked the process
For the #2 process, we must call "kill(getpid(), SIGKILL);" inside the conditional statement if(p == 0)

----Code----:

int main(void)
{
  int i;
  pid_t p;

  for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
    p = fork();
    if (p == 0) {
      close(0);
      close(1);
      close(2);
      if (i == 2) {
       setsid();
      }
      int s = getpid();
      kill(s, SIGKILL);
      sleep(D);
      return 0;
      }
  }
  return 0;
}

----------
To do this in shell script:
1. We compile and run the C program
gcc imtrash.c -o imtrash
./imtrash

2. We find the PID of the running processes in this program by using the command:
ps aux | grep username | grep imtrash | tail -6 | head -5
(we put our username after the first grep)
The PID is on the second column

3. To kill a running process, we call 
kill <PID of the process>
